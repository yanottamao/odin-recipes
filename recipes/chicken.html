    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breast halves, boneless, skin-on.</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil.</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt.</li>
        <li>Â½ cup water.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter.</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Season chicken on all sides with salt and ground black pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in an ovenproof skillet. Place chicken skin-side down in skillet and
                cook until
                browned, about 5 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Turn chicken over; stir mushrooms with a pinch of salt into skillet. Increase heat to high; cook,
                stirring mushrooms
                occasionally, until mushrooms shrink slightly, about 5 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the
                juices run clear,
                15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74
                degrees C).
                Transfer chicken breasts to a plate and loosely tent with foil; set aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 6
            <p>Set skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat; cook and stir mushrooms until brown bits start to form
                on the bottom
                of the pan, about 5 minutes. Pour water into the skillet, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned
                bits off of the
                bottom of the pan. Cook until water is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 7
            <p>Stir in any accumulated juices from the chicken into the skillet. Stir butter into mushroom mixture,
                stirring constantly
                until butter is completely melted and incorporated.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 8
            <p>Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mushroom sauce over chicken and serve.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
